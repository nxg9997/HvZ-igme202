Humans vs. Zombies

Description:
	This project is a simulation of humans vs zombies, where the humans attempt to stay alive by avoiding zombies, and zombies attempt to change humans into zombies by touching them.

User Responsibilities:
	The user can control the number of each element in the game - there is a slider for humans, zombies, and trees that can be moved to increase or decrease the starting number of each element. once the user has adjusted each slider, they can press the start button underneath the sliders to begin the simulation. The plus buttons next to the sliders now allow you to add one more zombie, human, or tree to the game. The reset button will restart the game, clearing all gameobjects from the scene. There is a dropdown menu for selecting the active camera, and a toggle button for turning on debug lines.

Above and Beyond:
	For above and beyond I decided to learn how to use canvas for the user's controls. I implemented buttons, sliders, dropdown menus, and toggles to control various parts of the game. I also used text elements to display the current number of humans and zombies in the top left.

Known Bugs:
	This only happened once or twice, but after a human becomes a zombie, the head of the human continues to wander throughout the scene. I think this is just an issue with the model that I used for the humans.

Notes:
	~Human & Zombie models are from the Unity Asset Store
	~Trees generated using Unity's built-in tree objects
	~Ground texture from Unity's environment package
	~Smooth follow script is provided in the HvZ project pdf
	~Game should be run in 1280x1024 (canvas gets cut off at other resolutions)
